# MemeApp2.0
Students have created an app that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share that meme on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. In this project, sent memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

## Concepts Learned
- Setting up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app
- Building tables with datasources and delegates
- Creating custom collection view cells
- Implementing user interfaces with tab views and collection views
